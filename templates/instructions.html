    <h1>Instructions for Taking the Leadership Assessment</h1>
    <div class="instructions">
        <p class="intro">This leadership assessment is designed to help you better understand your natural leadership
        tendencies and preferences. Your honest and thoughtful responses will provide the most
        accurate and useful results. Please read the following guidelines before you begin:</p>

        <div class="instruction-section">
            <h3>1. Be Honest</h3>
            <p>There are no right or wrong answers. The goal is to reflect your authentic self —
            not who you think you should be. Honest answers will result in the most valuable
            insights to help you grow as a leader.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="instruction-section">
            <h3>2. Don't Overthink, but Don't Rush</h3>
            <p>Read each question carefully, but avoid spending too much time trying to find a
            "perfect" answer. Go with the response that feels most natural or describes how
            you typically behave.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="instruction-section">
            <h3>3. Always and Never Are Rare — But Use Them if They Fit</h3>
            <p>While most situations are not black and white, if you feel that "always" or
            "never" truly applies to you for a certain question, don't be afraid to select it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="instruction-section">
            <h3>4. Choose a Quiet Environment</h3>
            <p>For best results, complete the assessment in a quiet, comfortable space with
            minimal distractions. This will allow you to focus and provide your most accurate
            responses.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="instruction-section">
            <h3>5. Complete the Assessment in One Sitting</h3>
            <p>Set aside enough time to complete the assessment in one uninterrupted session.
            This ensures your responses reflect a consistent mindset.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="instruction-section">
            <h3>6. Remember: There's No Perfect Leader</h3>
            <p>This assessment is not a test, and it does not measure success or failure.
            Different leadership styles are effective in different situations, and
            understanding your style is the first step to becoming an adaptable, self-aware
            leader.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="instruction-section">
            <h3>7. Provide Feedback to Help Us Improve</h3>
            <p>After completing the assessment questions, there will be a few additional
            questions aimed at helping us improve the assessment process. Your feedback is
            invaluable, and we appreciate your time in completing this section.</p>
        </div>

        <p class="final-note">Once you're ready, take a deep breath, relax, and begin.</p>
